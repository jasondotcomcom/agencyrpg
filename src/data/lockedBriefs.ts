I'm Priya, CMO at Threadbare. We've been making denim for 40 years. My parents wore our jeans. Their parents wore our jeans. And now we're watching sales decline because Gen Z thinks we're "old people jeans."

We need to become culturally relevant again without faking it. Because here's the thing: our quality is legitimately excellent, and our sustainability story is real — we use 100% recycled denim. We're not trying to manufacture authenticity. We have it. We just need someone to help us communicate it to a generation that wasn't alive when we started.

The challenge: How do you reach Gen Z without becoming embarrassing trying?

Budget: $150K. We have 10 weeks before our new collection drops.

Rachel Kwan here, VP of Theatrical Marketing at Meridian Studios.

I've got a situation. We have two films releasing the same weekend — July 18th — that could not be more different:

**"THE LEDGER"** — A gritty true crime thriller about a disgraced forensic accountant who discovers a money laundering operation inside the IRS. Dark, tense, Oscar-bait. Director is coming off a Venice Lion. Rated R.

**"GOOD BOY: THE MUSICAL"** — An animated family musical about a golden retriever named Biscuit who accidentally becomes a pop star after a TikTok goes viral. It's joyful, ridiculous, and the soundtrack is genuinely great. Rated G.

Here's the pitch: We want to manufacture a cultural moment.

You remember Barbenheimer? That wasn't planned. It just happened — the internet decided that seeing both Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day was an Event. It became a meme, then a movement, then a $2.4 billion box office weekend.

We want to do that — on purpose.

"The Ledger" by day, "Good Boy" by night. The Sad Dad Double Feature. The emotional whiplash weekend. We want the internet to decide that seeing both is the only correct move.

The problem: manufactured virality is an oxymoron. If it feels forced, the internet will roast us. We need it to feel organic, inevitable — like the audience invented it themselves.

Budget: $60,000 for the combined social/grassroots campaign (separate from each film's individual media buy).
Timeline: 26 days until the films are in theaters.

Make the internet obsessed with seeing both. Memes encouraged.

We have been monitoring your communications infrastructure for some time. Your species has reached a threshold where contact is... advisable.

We require assistance with what you call "public relations." Our research indicates that unmanaged first contact events result in panic, military escalation, and a 73% probability of your species shooting at us. We would prefer to avoid this.

Your agency has demonstrated an unusual capacity for making the unfamiliar feel approachable. This is precisely the skill set we require.

The brief is simple: Prepare humanity for the fact that they are not alone. Make it feel exciting, not terrifying. We have observed that your species responds poorly to surprises of this magnitude.

Budget is not a constraint. We have converted sufficient resources into your monetary system. $1,000,000 has been deposited.

Timeline: Flexible, but sooner is preferred. Your government has become... aware of our presence, and we would rather control the narrative.

We look forward to your creative recommendations.

    body: `Hi there,

I'm Vanessa Liu, managing partner at Liu & Associates. We handle crisis communications for high-profile clients.

I'll be direct: my client is Derek Fontaine. You've likely seen the coverage. Last month, the FBI released a tranche of documents from an unrelated securities investigation, and Derek's personal emails were included. The contents are... not flattering. Casual sexism toward female colleagues, discussions that suggest awareness of insider trades at his former fund, bullying subordinates — the full picture of a man who believed no one would ever read his private correspondence.

Derek has not been charged with anything. The legal team is handling that side. What we need is the public narrative.

I won't insult your intelligence by pretending this is a simple brand refresh. Derek's reputation is in freefall. His speaking engagements have been cancelled, his board seats are gone, and his foundation is hemorrhaging donors. He needs a comprehensive rehabilitation campaign.

Here's the uncomfortable part: we've approached four other agencies. They all declined. Your agency came up because, frankly, you're in a position where a $350,000 engagement might be hard to turn down. I don't say that to be cruel — I say it because I want us to be honest with each other from the start.

If you take this on, we'll be professional, we'll pay on time, and we'll give you creative latitude. Derek is genuinely committed to change (or at least, committed to being seen as committed to change — I'll let you decide which).

The brief is attached. Take your time with the decision.

Best,
Vanessa Liu

The emails reveal casual sexism, insider trading discussions, and systemic bullying of subordinates. He hasn't been charged, but public opinion has already convicted him.
