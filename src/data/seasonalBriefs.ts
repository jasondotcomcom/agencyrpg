      body: `Hello,

I'm Colette Renard, Chief Brand Officer at Maison Aura. We're an 80-year-old heritage fashion house, and we have a story we've never told — one that's long overdue.

Over half of our most iconic pieces were created by women who were never credited. Their male creative directors got the spotlight while the actual designers remained anonymous. We have the archives. We have the sketches. We have the names. And this Women's History Month, we want to correct the record.

We're planning to open the archives, name the names, and publicly reattribute the work. This isn't a feel-good campaign — it's an overdue reckoning with our own history.

We need the fashion press, culture writers, and our own customers to care about this. The risk is it looks like corporate guilt or a PR stunt. The opportunity is it becomes a genuine cultural moment that redefines how the industry treats attribution.

Budget: $75,000. We need this to land in March.

Colette`,

I'm Owen, owner of Decant — a wine bar in the arts district. Every March our business dies because everyone goes to sports bars for March Madness. Instead of fighting it, we want to lean in.

March Madness watch parties — but at a wine bar. Sommeliers doing color commentary. Wine pairings matched to regions. Bracket picks but for vintages. Make it absurd, make it fun, make the sports bar crowd curious enough to try something different.

We have a loyal clientele who think sports bars are beneath them and a sports crowd who think wine bars are pretentious. We need to bring both worlds together without alienating either.

Budget: $40,000. Small budget means scrappy execution — we can't buy media, we need to earn attention.
