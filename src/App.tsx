We're opening a specialty coffee shop in the Arts District next month, and I need your help with a real problem.\n\nHere's my situation: There are already 3 coffee shops within walking distance. People have their routines - their "usual spot." I'm not just competing on coffee quality (though ours is exceptional). I'm asking people to break a habit, leave their comfort zone, and try something new.\n\nWhat makes us different? We're building a community hub. Local artists display work on our walls. Musicians play on weekends. We host open mic nights. Every cup is ethically sourced and locally roasted. We're not trying to be the fastest or cheapest - we want to be the neighborhood's living room.\n\nBut how do I communicate that before people even walk in? How do I get them curious enough to break their routine?\n\nI don't want to just announce "new coffee shop opening!" - every business does that. I want people in the Arts District to feel like they've been waiting for us without knowing it.\n\nBudget is $50K - not huge, but enough to do something meaningful if we're smart about it.\n\nI trust your creative instincts. Tell me: how would you make people care?\n\nWarmly,\nMaya ✨`,
